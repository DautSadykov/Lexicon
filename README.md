This is a dictionary app that I developed using React.js

Recently I had an idea of creating an app that I could develop using all the skills that I've gained during my Front-end Developer path.
Here it is. Quite simple but still works quick and with no page reload.

I've also implemented React Redux to this project just to practice my skills, although it wasn't that necessary, 
since the app is quite simple.
